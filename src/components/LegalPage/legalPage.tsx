            Scope of the processing of personal data
          </h3>
          <p className='textPage'>
            In principle, we only process personal data of our users insofar as
            this is necessary in order to provide a functional website, as well
            as our content and services. The processing of the personal data of
            our users is regularly only carried out after obtaining the consent
            of the user. An exception applies in cases in which it is not
            possible to obtain consent in advance for factual reasons and the
            processing of the data is authorised through statutory provisions.

            Legal basis for the processing of personal data
          </h3>
          <p className='textPage'>
            Art. 6&#40;1&#41;&#40; a&#41; of the EU General Data Protection
            Regulation &#40;GDPR&#41; serves as legal basis insofar as we seek
            the consent of the data subject for processing operations of
            personal data. Art. 6&#40;1&#41;&#40;b&#41; of the GDPR serves as
            legal basis for the processing of personal data, which is necessary
            for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is
            party. The same applies to the processing operations that are
            necessary in order to take steps prior to entering into a contract.
            Art. 6&#40;1&#41;&#40;c&#41; of the GDPR serves as legal basis
            insofar as a processing of personal data is necessary for compliance
            with a legal obligation to which our company is subject. In the case
            that vital interests of the data subject or of another natural
            person necessitate the processing of personal data, Article
            6&#40;1&#41;&#40;d&#41; of the GDPR serves as the legal basis. Art.
            6&#40;1&#41;&#40;f&#41; of the GDPR serves as legal basis for the
            processing if the processing is necessary for the purposes of the
            legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party,
            except where such interests are overridden by the interests or
            fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject.

          <h3 className='subTitlePage'>Data erasure and storage period</h3>
          <p className='textPage'>
            The personal data of the data subject are erased or blocked as soon
            as the purpose of storage ceases to exist. Storage beyond this point
            can only occur if this is provided for by the European or national
            legislator in Union law regulations, laws or other provisions to
            which the controller is subject. Data are also blocked or erased
            when a storage period stipulated by the aforementioned standards
            expires, unless further storage of the data is necessary for the
            conclusion or performance of a contract.

            Description and scope of the data processing
          </h3>
          <p className='textPage'>
            Our website contains contact forms that can be used to make contact
            electronically. If a user chooses this option, the data entered into
            the input mask are transmitted to us and stored. These data are:
            &#40;a&#41; last name, &#40;b&#41; first name, &#40;c&#41; e-mail
            address and &#40;d&#41; message text. The date and time are also
            recorded. Within the framework of the sending process your consent
            to the processing of data is obtained and reference is made to this
            privacy policy. Alternatively, contact can also be established via
            the e-mail address provided. In this case, the user's personal data
            transmitted in the e-mail are stored. There is no data transfer to
            third parties in this context. The data are used exclusively for the
            processing of the conversation.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className='textSectionContainer'>
          <h3 className='subTitlePage'>Purpose of the data processing</h3>
          <p className='textPage'>
            The processing of the personal data from the input mask serves the
            sole purpose of handling the established contact. In the case that
            contact is established via e-mail this also constitutes the
            necessary legitimate interest in the processing of the data. Other
            personal data processed during the sending process serve the purpose
            of preventing a misuse of the contact form and ensuring the security
            of our information technology systems.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className='textSectionContainer'>
          <h3 className='subTitlePage'>Duration of storage</h3>
          <p className='textPage'>
            The data are erased as soon as they are no longer necessary in order
            to fulfil the purpose of their collection. For the personal data
            from the input mask of the contact form and the data sent via
            e-mail, this is the case when the respective conversation with the
            user has ended. The conversation has ended if it can be concluded
            from the circumstances that the issue in question has been resolved.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className='textSectionContainer'>
          <h3 className='subTitlePage'>Possibility of objection and erasure</h3>
          <p className='textPage'>
            The user has the right to withdraw consent to the processing of
            personal data at any time. If a user contacts us via e-mail, that
            user can object to the storage of that user's personal data at any
            time. In such a case the conversation cannot be continued. You can
            withdraw your consent at any time by sending an email to
            !!!!!!!!!d.schrimpf@dkfz.de. All personal data that were stored in
            the course of the establishment of contact will be erased in this
            case.
